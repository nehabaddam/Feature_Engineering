    "1.\tWhat are the two main strategies used in text summarization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarising is the process of extracting essential information from a certain text content. The goal of text summarization is to offer a brief and logical summary of the original text that highlights the most important aspects of it. Summaries can help users quickly understand the true meaning of a lengthy article, generate previews for search results, or provide a succinct overview of a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main approaches to text summarization :\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Extraction Summarization :\n",
    "\n",
    "This method chooses key sentences to create a summary. It will weigh and rank the most important parts of texts based on their relevance and similarity using statistical or ML techniques. The selected snetences are combined and a summary is generated with these statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Extractive summarization preserves the original wording and structure of the sentences, it may lack coherence if the generated words are not correctly connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Abstractive Summarization: \n",
    "\n",
    "It generates a summary by understanding the meaning of the text and generating new summarized sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach uses natural language processing techniques, such as language models or deep learning models, to assess the input text, interpret its semantic representation, and generate a more human like summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractive summarization allows for more flexibility and can result in more cohesive and meaningful summaries but the this method is more complicated.\n",

    "\n",
    "The feature used in the text summarixation code is \"sentence similarity measurement\". The approach computes sentence similarity using the cosine distance metic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We generate the text summarization code using the feature sentence similarity as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text Processing: Firstly, The stop words are removed. We can apply other text cleaning methods as well.\n",
    "2. Sentence Tokenization: Then, we tokenize the sentence i.e we divide it into words or tokens.\n",
    "3. Similarity Matrix: Then, we generate a similarity matrix. We build vector for sentences. Here we have used cosine similarity to find the similarities between the sentences. The algorithm computes cosine similarity by measuring the cosine of the angle between two vectors. Greater the value for cosine similarity, two vectors are more similar.\n",
    "4. Ranking Sentences: Now we rank sentences in the similarity matrix based on their similarity score. \n",
    "5. Sort Rank and pick top sentences: Now we sort all the sentences according to the rank and have selected the top sentences based on the rank.\n",
    "6. Print the output: Finally, we print the summarized text.\n",

    "Cosine similarity is used to compare each pair of the vectors. It is an abstractive method that calculates and reports the cosine of the angle between the vectors. Its value ranges from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (identical/similar). The value of 0 indicates that the vectors are independent of each other. Higher cosine similarity scores indicate greater content similarity. \n",
